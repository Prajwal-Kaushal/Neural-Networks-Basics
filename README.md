# Neural Networks Basics

This is a neural networks repository in which I will create complex neural networks without any libraries. I am referring to the book - "Neural Networks From Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça

All the python files are well commented and it starts from basic to advanced neural networks.
